##Nature-of-Code-on-Kadenze

This is my personal code repository for the examples, assignments, and explorations I completed while taking Daniel Shiffman's Nature of Code class on Kadenze.

All of this work has been based off the examples and instructions Daniel Shiffman provided during each session. All credit goes to him for making this subject matter so easy to understand and experiment with.
